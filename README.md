# üöÄ WordPress + Traefik Docker Setup ü¶Ü

This project provides a production-ready, Dockerized [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) environment with automatic SSL via [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) and a guided `.env` configuration.

With this setup it is possible to create a simple and production-ready setup for wordpress and make your website available on the internet via your own domain.

### Available documentation: 

| Language | Link               |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rocket-Quack/wordpress-traefik-docker.git
cd wordpress-traefik-docker
```

### 2. Run the setup script

```bash
./start.sh
```

This script will:

* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (only if `.env` does not yet exist)
* Prompt you interactively to confirm or change values (e.g., domain, passwords, paths)
* Launch all Docker containers detached using the `docker-compose.yml`


### 3.  Initial WordPress Setup

If this is the **first time** starting the WordPress site, you can complete the initial setup (language, site title, admin credentials, etc.) by visiting:

```
https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php
```

> Replace `yourdomain.com` with the domain you configured in the `.env` file.
> This step is required only once during the initial installation.


### 4. Accessing WordPress

Once started, your WordPress site will be available at:

```
https://yourdomain.com
```
> Make sure your domain‚Äôs DNS points to your server. Let's Encrypt requires this for SSL certificate generation.


## Requirements

### Software Requirements
Since the entire setup is based on Docker, Docker is required as the executing software. Further information on how and why Docker works can be found [here](https://www.docker.com/).

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Hosting Requirements

To run this setup, you‚Äôll need a server (VPS or cloud instance) with a public IP address and Docker installed. Any type of server that can be reached via an IP is possible. Also you can use popular hosting providers such as:

* [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)
* [IONOS by 1&1](https://www.ionos.com/servers/vps)
* [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* [Google Cloud Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)
* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/)

To enable traefik to issue a certificate, the correct ip of the target server must be entered in the dns settings.


## Used Images
These images are used in this setuip, together with the version and link to the public Docker Hub Registry.

- **WordPress**: Version 6.8.1 - PHP 8.2 - Apache ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress))
- **MariaDB**: Version 11.4.5 ([[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)])
- **Traefik**: Version 3.3 ([[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik)])

## üîê Security Considerations

* Traefik Dashboard is disabled by default (`TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD=false`)
* Database credentials and sensitive paths are managed via the `.env` file
* `.env` is excluded from Git using `.gitignore`


## üö¢ Managing Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d     # Start services in background

docker compose down      # Stop and remove containers

docker compose down -v   # Remove volumes and saved data:
```
